    "description": "<p>We are a group of passionate developers, designers, students, hobbyists and other curious people based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. We usually have a meetup every other month, where we have talks, presentations and discussions on JavaScript and Web development in general.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We meet at several regular venues around the City centre area. We cover JS and web dev fundamentals, frameworks, architecture, culture, tooling, browser internals, performance, UX, creative coding, game dev, and more.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Our format is normally 2-3 talks of 20-30 mins in length, with discussion/Q&amp;A after each. Occasionally we run a 'lightning round' format which involves around 8 or so talks of 10 minutes each. We are flexible in our format though, whatever works!</span></p>\n<p><span>Whether you're a grizzled veteran, developing your skills, new to the industry, a hobbyist, student, looking for a career change, or just interested in general, you'll find something worth attending for - all within a friendly, relaxed and diverse group of people.</span> <br></p>\n<p><span>Join us - all experience levels welcome! We are also always looking for new speakers, so if you fancy giving it a go, tell us!</span> <br></p>\n<p>Follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BelfastJS\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/BelfastJS</a>&nbsp;and hit us up with questions or requests to talk / topics you'd like to see covered!</p>",

We meet monthly and together we'll figure out how to rewire our brains to think and code functionally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meet-ups generally take the form of working on a shared programming challenge. You are encouraged to solve the problem in any language, ideally in collaboration with other attendees in the functional programming language / style of you choice. After a break for some refreshments, we then project a selection of the solutions on to the big screen for discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From time to time we change the format to more of a talk/workshop, given by either a member of the group, or an outside speaker. We try to ensure that talks are tailored to allow for some element of hands on coding.</p>",

If you answered at least one of these questions with \u201cYes\u201d, then you should come along to one of our meetings! We are all about providing resources and help for anyone seeking to secure their communication in a casual, fun, and positive environment. Our events are free of charge, open to anyone, and politically non-aligned. The topics which are covered in each session depend on what attendees are keen to learn. We normally tend to start off with a short presentation and then move to a hands-on part during which you will be able to get one-on-one help with electronic privacy tools. It is important that you bring your laptop to really get the most out of the meeting, but don\u2019t worry: No prior knowledge and skills on the subject-matter are expected!&nbsp;Further details and any of our used slides can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cryptoparty.in/belfast\">https://www.cryptoparty.in/belfast</a>.&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p><span>This is a meetup which is aimed at keeping software engineering students up to date on the latest technology stacks and current software trends that are being demanded by employers. We know it can be difficult as a student software developer heading out into industry for the first time, whether that be on your placement or your first graduate job. It can be very intimidating and challenging to filter out what you need to learn, especially when there seems to be a new framework being released every time you go online. (There probably is!) Well, Nigma was created to try and fix this. <br>We are aiming to bridge the gap between software dev. students in education and the workplace by providing a series of meetups that offers students the opportunity to talk about code, listen to kick ass talks on code and meet other passionate developers that are equally keen to learn about.... well...code. So if you're a student studying a computing related course or have just recently graduated then this is for you. For more information check out:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://nigma.io\">http://nigma.io</a><span>&nbsp; <br>If you fancy getting in contact send us a message: <br>email: hello@nigma.io <br>twitter: @nigmaio</span> <br></p>",

    "description": "<p>OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project, is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate approaching application security as a people, process, and technology problem because the most effective approaches to application security include improvements in all of these areas. We can be found at www.owasp.org. Local chapters provide a totally free meeting place for anyone interested in application security from three perspectives - builders, breakers and defenders. So come along to Belfast chapter meetings if you would like to hear about, or share information with the community on how to ethically hack your own systems, how to defend your applications and how to build security into your applications. Chapter meetings also provide a great opportunity to meet like-minded people with similar interests for general discussion, chit-chat and banter! Chapter website: <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belfast\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Belfast</a> Mailing list: <a href=\"https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Belfast\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"linkified\">https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Belfast</a> Although chapter meetings are provided free of charge, OWASP membership is encouraged. Besides supporting the organisation overall and your local chapter, membership funds will provide the holder with benefits in other areas such as free/discounted entry to conferences, etc.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The worlds of hackers and journalists are coming together as reporting goes digital and Internet companies become media empires.</p>\n<p>Journalists call themselves \"hacks,\" someone who can churn out words in any situation. Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code. Hacker-journalists try and bridge the two worlds.</p>\n<p>This group is to bring all these people together -- those who are working to help people make sense of their world. It's for hackers exploring technologies to filter and visualize information, and for journalists who use technology to find and tell stories. In the age of information overload, all their work has become even more crucial.</p>\n<p>This group aims to help members find inspiration and think in new directions, bringing together potential collaborators for projects and new ventures.</p>\n<p>Please also check out our blog at <a href=\"http://hackshackers.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://hackshackers.com</a> Help us build the future of media!</p>",
